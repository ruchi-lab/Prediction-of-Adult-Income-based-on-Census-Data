# Prediction-of-Adult-Income-based-on-Census-Data
A Data Mining Approach to Economic Insights

## Prerequisites

### Ensure you have the following installed:
•	Python 3.x
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, Pillow, tkinter (should be included in standard Python installations)

## Installation
1.	Clone the Repository: Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2.	Install Required Libraries:
    Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries (if not already installed):
# 	
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib Pillow 

## Dataset
The project utilizes the U.S. Census Income dataset.
Ensure the dataset file (typically named adult.csv) is placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook (myNotebook.ipynb).

## Running the Project
### 1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook in your environment.
Navigate to the directory containing myNotebook.ipynb and open it.
### 2.	Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to observe data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
### 3.	Tkinter Application:
The project includes a Tkinter-based GUI application for making predictions.
Run the relevant Python script or cells in the notebook to launch the GUI.
Enter the input values in the GUI and click "Predict" to view the income prediction.
### Notes
The notebook includes detailed comments explaining each step of the analysis and model building process.
The GUI application is a simple demonstration and might require adjustments based on your system and dataset.
